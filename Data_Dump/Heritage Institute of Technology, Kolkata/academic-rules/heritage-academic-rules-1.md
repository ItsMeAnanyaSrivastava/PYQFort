- Core specialization starts from 3rd semester.
✅ Yes / ❌ No (mention what applies)

### ACR2:
- Core subjects for branches under same department overlap in syllabus and PYQs.
✅ Yes / ❌ No

Examples:
- CSE, IT, and DS have similar core subjects and PYQs.
- ECE and EE share Digital Electronics, Signals & Systems.

## 🧠 PYQ Pattern Observations
- Many PYQs repeat over the years (80% repetition in some cases).
- PYQs are often sourced from:
  - Old PYQs
  - Assignment problems
  - Lecture notes
- Professors hint expected questions in class.

## 📚 Book & Lecture Recommendations
Professors recommend:
- Galvin for OS
- Cormen for Algorithms
- NPTEL lectures for DBMS and Networks
- Gate Smashers / Jenny’s Lectures on YouTube
