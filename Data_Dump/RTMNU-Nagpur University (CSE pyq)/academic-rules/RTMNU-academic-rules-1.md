## ðŸ§¾ Academic Common Rules

ACR1:
- Semester 1 and 2: Same syllabus + Same PYQs for CSE, IT, CT, CE
âœ… Yes

ACR2:
- Core subjects for branches under same department overlap in syllabus and PYQs
âœ… Yes

Examples:
- CSE, IT, CT, CE share foundational subjects like Data Structures, OS, Networks, DBMS.

## ðŸ§  PYQ Pattern Observations

- PYQs show moderate repetition (~60â€“70%).
- Sources include:
- Previous year papers
- Lab assignments
- Lecture notes
- NPTEL-based subjects often align with expected questions.

## ðŸ“š Book & Lecture Recommendations

Faculty and students recommend:
- Galvin for OS
- Cormen for Algorithms
- NPTEL lectures for DBMS, Networks, AI
- Gate Smashers / Jennyâ€™s Lectures / CodeWithHarry for programming concepts
