# Delhi University Academic Structure and Rules

## Academic Structure of College

Delhi University (DU) follows a structured academic curriculum for its undergraduate programs, including B.Sc. (Hons.) Computer Science. The curriculum is divided into Core Courses (DSC), Skill Enhancement Courses (SEC), Value Added Courses (VAC), and Ability Enhancement Courses (AEC). Each semester typically includes a mix of these courses.

### Classification of Branch Syllabus
- **DSC (Discipline Specific Course):** Core subjects for Computer Science.
- **SEC (Skill Enhancement Course):** Practical/skill-based papers (e.g., Web Development, Python Programming).
- **VAC (Value Added Course):** Courses for holistic development (e.g., Environmental Science, Ethics).
- **AEC (Ability Enhancement Course):** Language and communication skills (e.g., English, Hindi, Communication).

### Semester-wise Subject List (B.Sc. (Hons.) Computer Science)

#### Semester 1
- Computer System Architechture
- Mathematics for Computing
- Programming using Python

#### Semester 2
- Discrete Mathematics
- Object Oriented Programming with C++
- Probability for Computing

#### Semester 3
- Computer Graphics
- Operating Systems
- Data Structures 

#### Semester 4

> For other branches (e.g., Electronics, Mathematics), the structure is similar with branch-specific DSC and DSE subjects.

### Academic Common Rules
- **ACR1:** Delhi University follows a common syllabus for 1st and 2nd semesters across science branches, with core specialization starting from 3rd semester.
- **ACR2:** Overlap exists in core subjects for similar branches (e.g., CSE, IT, Data Science) in higher semesters, especially in electives and SECs.

## Other Details

### PYQ Repeating Pattern
- PYQs often repeat from previous years, especially for core DSC subjects.
- Some questions are derived from assignments and lab work.
- Professors' lecture notes are a common source for PYQs.
