Q1 A motorist traveling at 15 m/s passes a school crossing with a 10 m/s speed limit. A police officer starts pursuing with a constant acceleration of 3.0 m/s².  
   (a) How much time elapses before the officer passes the motorist?  
   (b) What is the officer’s speed at that time?  
   (c) How far has each vehicle traveled?

Q2 A 500-N crate is pulled with 230 N to initiate movement, and 200 N to continue it.  
   What are the coefficients of static and kinetic friction?  
   What is the friction force if a 50 N force is applied while the crate is at rest?
