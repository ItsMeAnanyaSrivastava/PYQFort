Part A (30 Marks)
Q1 Find the current in the 2 Ω resistor in the network of Fig. 1

Q2 Find Norton’s equivalent network at the terminals A and B of Fig. 2

Q3 Determine I, V1, V2, and V0 for the series DC configuration of Fig. 3.  
   Consider the value of 0.7V for the silicon diode to move from off state to on state.

Part B (20 Marks)
Q4 Why the gate-to-source voltage is not used in an N Channel Depletion-type MOSFET?  
   What is pinch–off voltage and what happens to the drain-to-source current at this point?  
   Explain the working with the help of a neat sketch.

Q5 Realize XOR and XNOR gates using NAND and NOR gates respectively.
