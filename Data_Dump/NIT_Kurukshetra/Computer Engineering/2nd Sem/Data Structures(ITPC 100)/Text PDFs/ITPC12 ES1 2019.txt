PART A
Q1 (a) What do you mean by pointer? How to pass pointers in functions?	(3)
   (b) What do you mean by dynamic memory allocation. What function or functions can be used for dynamic memory allocation.	(2)
   (c) WAP in C language to sort n elements using Merge sort.	(5)
Q2 (a) Convert the following infix expression to its postfix form using stack. A + B - C*D/E + F. (5)
                                       OR
   (a) Evaluate the following prefix expression : * + 4 3 2 5 Show diagrammatically each step of evaluation using stack. (5)
   (b) WAP in C language to implement a stack using an array. (5)
Q3 (a) WAP in C program to reverse only first n elements of a Linked List (3)
   (b) Describe an algorithm to evaluate postfix expression using STACK. (3)
                                       OR
   (b) Show how to implement three stack in one array.	
   (c) Take a queue containing numbers 10, 15, 5, 25, 30 in which 30 has been inserted first. After performing the following operations, what would be the contents of the queue ? (4)
    i. Delete two elements
    ii. Insert 7 and then 20
    iii. Delete an element
Q4 (a) 'Recursion is better than iteration'. Critically comment on this statement.
   (b) Usually a queue is implemented using two pointers, viz., front and rear. Is it possible to implement a linked queue that requires only one pointer? If yes, how to implement it?
   (c) Write a recursive algorithm to count the number of elements in an array. Explain the advantages and disadvantages of using recursive formulation of an algorithm compared to non-recursive formulation.
Q5 (a) Given the following in-order and pre-order traversal reconstruct a binary tree:  (5)
       Inorder sequence: D, G, B, H, E, A, F, I, C
       Preorder sequence: A, B, D, G, E, H, C, F, I
Q6 (b) Sort the given list using Heap Sort :66, 33, 40, 20, 50, 88, 60, 11, 77, 30, 45, 65. (5)
