## 🧾 Academic Common Rules

### ACR1:
- Semester 1 and 2: Same syllabus + Same PYQs for all branches(for the subjects that are shared).
- Core specialization starts from 3rd semester.
✅ Yes / ❌ No (mention what applies)

### ACR2:
- Core subjects for branches under same department overlap in syllabus and PYQs.
✅ Yes / ❌ No

Examples:
- CSE , AI & IT shares same subjects like DBMS,Computer Networks, Computer Graphics with passing semesters
- CSE & ECE students shares subjects like Discrete,HSS  

## 🧠 PYQ Pattern Observations
- Many PYQs repeat over the years (80% repetition in some cases).
- PYQs are often sourced from:
  - Older PYQs
  - MOOCS lectures from IIT's , NIT's
  - Assignment problems
  - Lecture notes
- Professors hint expected questions in class.

## 📚 Book & Lecture Recommendations
Professors recommend:
- Galvin for OS
- Morris Mano for COA
