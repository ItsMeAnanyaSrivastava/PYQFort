## üìä Observed PYQ Trends

* ‚úÖ **Repetition from Previous Years:**
  Several questions, both theoretical and numerical, are repeated over the years with minor variations.

* ‚úÖ **Assignment-Driven PYQs:**
  Many exam questions are inspired directly from class assignments or lab tasks.

* ‚úÖ **Class Notes-Based Questions:**
  Faculty often frame questions around concepts and derivations discussed in lectures.
